### **What is Property Panel?**

Once a product or entity from the warehouse is added to the room design, a pop-up will appear on the screen. Through this, you can alter properties like dimensions, materials, and accessories of the item to generate a base costing.

### **Dimensions** 
Here, a designer can alter an item's height, width and depth in real time.  

### **Material**
The Material option will allow you to change the properties of the carcass, shutter or the visible side per the client’s requirements. The designer can choose materials brand-wise or variant-wise depending on their availability in the company's inventory. 

**E.g.-** If the client wishes to change the colour of their cabinetry, or they wish to switch the brands of the carcass box, then the materials option will come in handy.

### **Handles** 
Here, the designer can change the hardware orientation, size orientation, shape, brand, finish, and colour. 

***\*Handles can be added and changed in Room Settings as well.***

### **Accessories**
Accessories are primarily used to modify the hardware and decorative pieces that are added along with your entity. 

**E.g.-** If the client wishes to view images of different hardware like handles and decides to change its properties, you can use the *Accessory* option to do the job easily without going back to room settings.
