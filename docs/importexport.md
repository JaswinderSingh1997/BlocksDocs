### Layers 

![layericon](../static/img/importExport/layers.png)  
This trigger tool hides and unhides entities from the floor plan ensuring the client gets better clarity. 

**Eg. -** If the client wishes to view the kitchen design without the loft or base cabinets for increased clarity, the designer can simply hide certain layers from the design instead of deleting entities using Layers.

The import tool helps the designer add files or pre-made designs in JPG format and 3D models to the design. 

![export](../static/img/importExport/export.png)

The export tool helps to export 2D drawings and cut lists. 

### Lights

Or 

![moonicon](../static/img/importExport/moonicon.png)

This design tool helps add a source of illumination to the room. From basic illumination to providing multiple light sources to achieve a more realistic view. It also gives the client a better picture of their ready room.

### Environment Settings 

![environmentsettings](../static/img/importExport/environmentsettings.png)

Environment settings are provided to alter the exterior settings of a project. Many settings, like the placement of the sun and directions, are provided to make the view more realistic to enhance the overall view. 

**E.g.**- In the case of providing a realistic view to the client, the most relevant option can be selected. Clients will be able to visualise their house in a relatable space. 

### View
